  intro: (
    <>
      I am a passionate self-taught UI & UX designer (and former restaurateur & chef). I take
      ownership of my projects and ensure that user stories reflect my clients best interests. I am
      always open to learn and up for new challenges. I manage myself well and keep an objective
      mind as I like to be pro-active. I know I have a lot to offer and I am willing to go the extra
      mile

You can point out a problem to him and know that it will be handled, and he brings a positive vibe to the team at the same time. His approach to web is modern and progressive, and it is very refreshing. Furthermore, he has a real passion for web development, producing excellent results, being up to date with all the latest technology and being reliable and easy to work with. Ask him about anything from performance to accessibility or on-site tech support, he'll go out of his way to find a solution.",

        "Felix has a highly technical aptitude, which is further enhanced by his experience and general desire to be the best. My favorite thing about working with Felix is his ability to tell when a problem needs to be fixed right away and when a problem needs to be solved quickly. Whatever he does, he is always dedicated to doing an excellent job, and he makes the right engineering decisions for the project. In addition to learning new technologies at an exceptionally fast rate, he is often the first one to come to when a technical problem arises. In his role as a team player, Felix appears equally comfortable joining a project team and working directly on it, mentoring less experienced developers, or leading a project as a technical lead. Felix has always been a pleasant presence at customer meetings, as he is able to answer questions clearly and accurately, and he is not afraid to express his opinion on technical issues as well. I will miss working with Felix and will be confident in recommending him for any technical position in the future. He is well liked and highly respected by his colleagues from all areas of the business.",

  personal: `After spending my childhood in Germany and early work career, I moved to Cape Town 14 years ago. Cooking and hosting dinners for family and friends are some of my favorite activities, and I enjoy connecting with people through good food, technology, and intelligent discussion. You will often find me on and around Table Mountain, hiking or running with my dog Alpha. I am very excited about the new age Space Race and the innovation it brings, and I would like to witness a rocket launch in my lifetime. It is also important to me to keep up with web technology and UX design developments by listening to podcasts, attending local events, attending conferences, and using Twitter.`,
