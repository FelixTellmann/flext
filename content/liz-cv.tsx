  intro: (
    <>
      I am a passionate UX/UI Designer specializing in Ecommerce theme designs. With years of
      experience designing Shopify sites, I have developed a deep understanding of the Shopify
      platform and its unique design requirements. I work closely with clients to create custom
      themes that are tailored to their specific needs, with a focus on delivering designs that are
      not only visually stunning, but also easy to use and navigate.
      <br />
      <br />
      My design process is collaborative and user-centred, with a strong emphasis on usability
      testing and feedback. I believe that great design is not just about aesthetics, but also about
      solving problems and creating meaningful experiences for users.

              LunaTag, is a Shopify app that enables users to tag their products on their images,
              making their online store more engaging and shoppable. The goal of the project was to
              simplify the process of adding product tags to images for Shopify store owners, while
              also aligning with the requirements of the Shopify platform. Through a combination of
              research, design, and testing, I was able to design an intuitive and effective app
              that helps store owners better showcase their products and increase sales.{" "}

              Clickupload is a Shopify application that enables merchants to create personalized
              products by uploading files. As part of the app team, I worked on UX and UI design. An
              essential feature of the app is that it fully integrates into merchants' theme editors
              and can be tailored to match any brand style. We aimed to make the app easy to use for
              users while accommodating merchant purchase information needs.

My favorite thing about working with Felix is his ability to tell when a problem needs to be fixed right away and when a problem needs to be solved quickly. Whatever he does, he is always dedicated to doing an excellent job, and he makes the right engineering decisions for the project. In addition to learning new technologies at an exceptionally fast rate, he is often the first one to come to when a technical problem arises. In his role as a team player, Felix appears equally comfortable joining a project team and working directly on it, mentoring less experienced developers, or leading a project as a technical lead. Felix has always been a pleasant presence at customer meetings, as he is able to answer questions clearly and accurately, and he is not afraid to express his opinion on technical issues as well. I will miss working with Felix and will be confident in recommending him for any technical position in the future. He is well liked and highly respected by his colleagues from all areas of the business.",
