  intro: (
    <>
      I am a passionate UI & UX designer (and a former restaurateur & chef). I take responsibility
      for my projects with attention to detail and ensure user stories reflect the objectives and
      interests of my clients. Keeping an objective mind and being proactive are two qualities I
      possess that help me manage myself well. I thrive in team-oriented environments and enjoy
      challenges and opportunities.

Whatever he does, he is always dedicated to doing an excellent job, and he makes the right engineering decisions for the project. In addition to learning new technologies at an exceptionally fast rate, he is often the first one to come to when a technical problem arises. In his role as a team player, Felix appears equally comfortable joining a project team and working directly on it, mentoring less experienced developers, or leading a project as a technical lead. Felix has always been a pleasant presence at customer meetings, as he is able to answer questions clearly and accurately, and he is not afraid to express his opinion on technical issues as well.
