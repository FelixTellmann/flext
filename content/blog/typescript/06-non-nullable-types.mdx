In this article, we'll discuss `non-nullable` types, which give the type system a fundamental boost by helping prevent nullability errors at compile time.

## The`null` and `undefined` Values

Until TypeScript 2.0, the type checker considered `null` and `undefined` to be valid values of `every` type. Null and undefined were valid values for primitive types such as strings, numbers, and booleans:

```ts
let name: string;
name = "Felix"; // OK
name = undefined; // OK
name = null; // OK

let age: number;
age = 36; // OK
age = undefined; // OK
age = null; // OK

let hasDog: boolean;
hasDog = true; // OK
hasDog = false; // OK
hasDog = undefined; // OK
hasDog = null; // OK
```

In the past, type systems weren't able to express that a certain variable was not nullable. One example is the `number` type, whose domain includes not only all floating point numbers but also the two special values `null` and `undefined`. This was also true for `objects`, `arrays`, and `functions`. Luckily, TypeScript 2.0 has resolved this problem.

## Strict Null Checking

You can enable the`strictNullChecks` mode by providing the `--strictNullChecks` flag on the command line. Alternatively, you can enable it in your project's `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strictNullChecks": true
    // ...
  }
}
```

As soon as we compile our previous examples with strict null checking enabled, we get a type error when we attempt to assign `null` or undefined` to any variable:

```ts
// Compiled with --strictNullChecks

let name: string;
name = "Felix"; // OK
name = undefined; // Error
name = null; // Error

let age: number;
age = 24; // OK
age = undefined; // Error
age = null; // Error

let hasDog: boolean;
hasDog = true; // OK
hasDog = false; // OK
hasDog = undefined; // Error
hasDog = null; // Error
```

So how do we make a variable nullable?

## Modeling Nullability with Union Types

When strict null checking is enabled, types aren't nullable by default. Thus, to enable nullability, we need to specify which variables will be nullable here. This is done by creating a union type containing the nullable and undefined types (Read more about <Link href="/posts/typescript/06-non-nullable-types">Union Types</Link>):

```ts
let name: string | null;
name = "Felix"; // OK
name = undefined; // Error
name = null; // OK
```

This type union does not contain a type named `undefined`, so `undefined` cannot be used as a value for the _name_ variable. A big advantage of this approach is that it becomes obvious and self-documenting which members of a type are nullable.

```ts
type User = {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string | undefined;
};

const nicole: User = { firstName: "Nicole", lastName: undefined };
const jimmy: User = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Doe" };
```

It is possible to make the `lastName` property optional by appending the symbol ? to its name, which allows us to omit the definition of the `lastName` property entirely. Also, the `undefined` type is automatically added to the union type, so the following assignment is type-correct:

```ts
type User = {
  firstName: string;
  lastName?: string;
};

// We can assign a string to the "lastName" property
const jimmy: User = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Doe" };

// ... or we can explicitly assign the value undefined
const nicole: User = { firstName: "Nicole", lastName: undefined };

// ... or we can not define the property at all
const tom: User = { firstName: "Tom" };
```

## Property Access with Nullable Types

Accessing any property of a `null`-type or `undefined`-type object results in a compile-time error:

```ts
function getLength(s: string | null) {
  // Error: Object is possibly 'null'.
  return s.length;
}
```

Type guards are used to ensure that an object's property access is safe before you access its properties:

```ts
function getLength(s: string | null) {
  if (s === null) {
    return 0;
  }

  return s.length;
}
```

Because TypeScript supports type guarding in conditional expressions and understands JavaScript's truthiness semantics, this approach also works:

```ts
function getLength(s: string | null) {
  return s ? s.length : 0;
}
```

## Function Invocations with Nullable Types

A compile-time error is produced when you attempt to call a type that includes `null` or `undefined`. The `callback` parameter below is optional (note the `?`), so it may be `undefined`. Therefore, it is not possible to call this function directly:

```ts
function doSomething(callback?: () => void) {
  // Error: Object is possibly 'undefined'.
  callback();
}
```

We need to check first whether the function has a non-null value, similar to checking for objects before accessing a property:

```ts
function doSomething(callback?: () => void) {
  if (callback) {
    callback();
  }
}
```

If you prefer, you can check the value returned by the `typeof` operator:

```ts
function doSomething(callback?: () => void) {
  if (typeof callback === "function") {
    callback();
  }
}
```

## Summary

In TypeScript, non-nullable types are fundamental and valuable. They provide an accurate model of which variables and properties are nullable. A property access or function call is only permitted if a type guard has deemed it safe. This prevents many nullability errors at compile time.
