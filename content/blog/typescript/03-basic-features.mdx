Lets have a look at how we can use typescript in our code and make use of TypeScripts powers to make
coding easier and more predictable. The simple yet powerful _main feature_ of TypeScript is to add
_type annotations_ to variables or functions.

Some of the valid TypeScript types are:

- `number`
- `string`
- `boolean`
- `Array`
- `enum`
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `void`
- `tuple`
- `never`
- `any`
