While it shares the same name as JavaScript's operator `typeof`, TypeScript's `typeof` keyword captures anonymous types in a rather different way - the two can only appear in mutually exclusive contexts.

## JavaScript's`typeof` Operator

ECMAScript 2015 features the `typeof` operator that returns a string representing the type of its operand. It returns one of seven string values:

```js
typeof 1234; // "number"
typeof true; // "boolean"
typeof {}; // "object"
typeof undefined; // "undefined"
typeof "Hello World!"; // "string"
typeof Symbol(); // "symbol"
typeof parseInt; // "function"
```

As TypeScript is a strict superset of JavaScript, every valid JavaScript program is a TypeScript program. Therefore, the `typeof` operator works with both languages:

```ts
const number: string = typeof 1234;
```

The emitted JavaScript code is almost unchanged:

```js
const number = typeof 1234;
```

## TypeScript's Type Queries

In TypeScript, the typeof keyword is used to initiate a **type query**. A type query gets the type of an _identifier_ or _property access expression_ (which is a connection of multiple identifiers):

```ts
const box = { width: 100, height: 200 };
let anotherBox: typeof box;
```

The type of the `box` variable is inferred from its declaration with the annotation `typeof box` because no type annotation was provided on the variable declaration. We can give the same type to `anotherBox` by annotating the variable declaration with the type query `typeof box`.

As with other static type system artifacts, type queries do not manifest at runtime. They are completely removed from the generated JavaScript code:

```js
const box = { width: 100, height: 200 };
let anotherBox;
```

## Naming Types with Type Aliases

In TypeScript, we can give the captured anonymous type a name using a **type alias**. Then, use that name with TypeScript wherever it expects a type:

```ts
const box = { width: 100, height: 200 };

// Obtain the type of `box` and call it `Box`
type Box = typeof box;

let anotherBox: Box;
```
