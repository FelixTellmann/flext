As a JavaScript developer, you already know what TypeScript is and why it is useful.
If you don't know, this article will explain the benefits of using TypeScript over
JavaScript and how to get started with TypeScript

JavaScript is a powerful programming language, yet you can easily start the adventure
with it.One problem, though, is that apps these days are more complex as users expect from
them more than ever before. JavaScript is no longer just an ornament on a website, you
can use it to build some pretty advanced applications. Furthermore, these apps can
have tons of possible states, which make it difficult to fully test them. This is where
JavaScript's dynamic nature breaks the developer experience, as instant feedback that the
developer once received is no longer the same.

## Why should I use TypeScript?

TypeScript is an open-source programming language created by Microsoft. Actually, it‚Äôs a
superset of JavaScript which adds static typing to the language. The compilation of
TypeScript to JavaScript allows the code to run on any environment that supports
JavaScript. The web browser can be used as a client or Node.js can be used as a server.

Now you may ask: "Ok, but why do I need static typing at all? If TypeScript compiles
to JavaScript, shouldn't JavaScript be enough?"?

If you want to write everything in pure JS, then you can, but why hurt yourself? It's
always better to know what type you need than not to.

It's just inevitable that there will be bugs in programming. Sometimes it's just a
typo and sometimes it's rushing before the deadline. Imagine that you are creating a
payroll system for your company that automatically handles the paychecks of your
employees. Such a system should be first and foremost reliable, right?

We'll look at an example. Suppose you need to calculate employee salary with bonuses.
Your function might look like this:

Now let's take a look at this example. Suppose you have a really complicated function
for calculating salaries with bonuses. In plain Javascript, it may look like this:

```js
function calculateSalaryWithBonus(salary, bonus) {
  return salary + bonus;
}
```

We assume that this function takes numbers as arguments and should work flawlessly when
applied to calculating salary and automatically transferring money to employees.
Suppose you get a list of bonuses as strings instead of numbers because of a bug in your
backend code or application code. What could possibly go wrong here?

```js
const salary = calculateSalaryWithBonus(5000, "0");
// salary is 50000 üò±üò±üò±
```

As it turns out, the person would be happy to get an additional 0 at the end of the salary
amount rather than no bonus at all. Because JavaScript is dynamic, you may get unexpected
results even if you built this function with the intention of adding numbers.

Here is how the function would look like in TypeScript:

```ts
function calculateSalaryWithBonus(salary: number, bonus: number) {
  return salary + bonus;
}
```

If we try to assign the salary no with a string, we would get the following error:

```ts
const salary = calculateSalaryWithBonus(5000, "0");
// Error: TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```

I know that this example seems trivial, but remember... Static types can help prevent
certain problems even at the software development stage.

Another reason to go for TypeScript over JavaScript is that TS is _self-documenting_.
The code that you write, will literally explain itself to you or any other person
reading your code. With JavaScript, we are often forced to read entire libraries of
documentation (if there is any at all) to just find a small piece of information that's
applicable in a given situation. In TypeScript, we often end up writing quite a bit
more as we code along, but we are also writing the documentation (which can often be
extracted with some wonderful developer tools). Furthermore, we when we read the code,
we get the bits of documentation as they are needed, and just what we need without
having to search for it.

### Unlock Typescript superpowers with your IDE

The vast majority of developers spend most of their time in an IDE (integrated
development environment, like WebStorm) or a lightweight editor like VSCode. Sure, we
could all write our code in a notepad, but that would be time consuming and painful. In
IDEs, TypeScript provides many features, for instance:

- **Type checking in real-time** - In JavaScript, all the properties of an object can be
  accessed even if they don't exist (i.e., "undefined"). This often leads to errors that
  are
  difficult to track down, but with Typescript, your IDE tells you in real-time when you
  are
  trying to access something that doesn't exist.
- **Autocomplete** - The code auto-completion is just faster and works more efficiently in
  static type languages IDEs. Code hints make it so you don't have to dig into
  documentation.
- **Mouse hover support** Simply hover over the area of code you are interested in,
  and you'll be able to see more details.

In the end, when you use Typescript, your IDE becomes best friend. The
hints, red underlines, and warning messages give you the impression that someone warns
you, ‚ÄúHey, you made a mistake here, check it out!‚Äù. There are a number of Javascript
plug-ins that allow you to accomplish similar (but not identical) results, but they
eventually cannot compete with Typescript's rich features.

### Use Typescript inference and don't event write more

It may seem that Typescript is more code writing-intensive than Javascript because you
must declare all types for variables, function arguments, function return types etc. But
Typescript also incorporates a powerful feature known as type inference. Simply put,
Typescript can identify the type of a variable by its value or a function result by its
body.
