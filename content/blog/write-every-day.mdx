Writing is something I've been trying to get into for quite some time now. I've read about how to write, about writing well, how to break out of the rut, and how to kickstart a writing habit. I've been writing with pen and paper in the past, but realized that I get a writing fatigue and never pick it up again. From there, procrastination has taken over and I've only written on a physical page maybe once or twice.

I've also tried writing on the computer, using many different tools and platforms and so far couldn't really find one that suits all my needs, especially being able to write from any device at any time without it feeling like a pain.

Today. I wrote. I journaled about my thoughts and planned out my coming week. I wrote down what has been circling in my mind for the last 3 months. I gave it an outlet in the form of writing, a format that's worked for me in the past but for some reason, I stopped.

Once I wrote, I felt free. I didn't want to stop writing. I opened my code edtior, opened a new markdown file for my blog, and wrote this. I almost found a way to procrastinate by asking "but what should I write about".

But then a voice in my head (I'm not crazy) said - it doesn't matter. What matters is that I write. And so I wrote.

What matters is that words get out onto paper (or screen in this case) and that I make it a point to just write everyday. Even if things at first look likle non-sense ðŸ™ƒ

Write more! Just Write.
