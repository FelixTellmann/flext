Have you ever ended up with 100+ tabs open on your browser? Ever wondered how you can be
more productive? Well, I've been there. Many many times!
The reality is that we are programmed as humans to conserve energy and be as lazy as
possible. Being productive, requires initial _thinking_, and _thinking_ literally requires
your brain to use more calories.

So how then can we stay productive, knowing that we are faced with a constant force
towards lazyness & procrastination?
We can trick ourselves into being productive and pre-plan for moments of weakness.

Here is how I do it:

## 1. Know what needs to be done.

At any given point, I can be in one of two states. Either I _Know_ the precise steps
on a given task/project at hand, or I _don't know_ what needs to be done or have wage
instructions. If I _know_ what needs to be done, guess what..., being productive is going
to be easy, following the step by stpe. If I, on the other hand, don't know exactly what
to do (most tasks require some part of learning & understanding), I am very likely to
procrastinate as I attempt something I don't know how to. My trick here is to STOP, THINK
and PLAN. I ask myself the following questions to guide me: "How does it look like if I
compelte this task/project?", "What do I not fully understand?", and "What are all the
steps to complete the task?". I usually end up with a list that has some clear tasks, and
some things that require learning & research. I then add the learning onto the list as a
task itself. Only once I can say that I _Know_ the steps to complete the project, will I
continue working on it.

Here is an example:

## 2. Know the bigger picture (Some day)

## 3. Plan Weekly - timeblocking

## 4. Don't leave things incomplete (delete your bookmarks)

## 5. Measure your productivity (adjust your plan)

## 6. Relax, take time for yourself

## 7. Turn things into Habits
