In the past, Liz and I had a lot of approaches on how to be more successful as entrepreneurs, figuring out what other projects we can do to create Value (and make money). We pursued different approaches, such as funding full-sized Tech Startups looking to disrupt the Hospitality Education Industry (that required VC / Start-up funding), building Shopify Apps and selling marketplaces, Ecommerce Stores, as well as developing our own Web Development Agency.

## Taking inventory

Recently, we took the time to re-evaluate our position among the different projects and how we have diversified our energies. We have analysed how it would look like if we pursued only one project with full focus.

We compared Ecommerce Store vs. Shopify Apps vs. Web Development Agency with a list of selection criteria / key factors that are important to us:

- Financial / Scalability
- MVP - Skills / Know-how required
- Capital requirements
- Timeframe / Scalablity
- Workstyle Balance
- Team
- Stress

We went into detail, especially on the financial side, getting a good overview of how a ONE thing focus would look like for each of the projects. A critical factor in this, is also that our Web Agency already has existing clients and that we no matter what, would keep it running to a certain degree.

The review leaned strongly to puruse the Agency in a much more Focused approach and to completely cut the other areas out. (We probably would keep the Apps on a self-maintaining level and keep our options open for future focus as we already have 2 Apps in the Shopify app store.)

So, that being said, lets look at what areas we'd need to focus on to make the Web Dev Agency take off ✈️.

## Scaling the Web Dev Agency

Areas of potential Focus:

- Online Ads
- Onboarding Flow
- Service Offering - Getting all the detail of what & What-not
- Website upgrade - Add Channel: Lunalemon
- Project Management Optimization
- Communication Standards / templates
- Work Tracking / Time Analysis
- Internal Time Schedule - Setting times for things
- Goal Setting
