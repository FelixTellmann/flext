Starting an E-Commerce business has been on my list for a while now and yet I haven't made any productive steps
towards that goal. I've always been on the lookout to create new businesses with diversified revenue streams. In the
past I've co-developed businesses like [Shopify Apps](https://apps.shopify.com/lunatag) and a small [E-commerce &
webdevelopment agency](https://www.tellmann.co.za) with my wife Elizabeth.

The main reason that I've never created an E-commerce store yet was mostly that I never created a plan to do so. So
here is my plan, starting from absolute scratch, no idea in the pipeline.

## E-commerce Overview

Firstly, let's look at what it is that makes up an E-Commerce business and what its primary activities are:

### E-Commerce Business Model

I'll be looking at an E-commerce Store as a stand-alone business in a Business to Consumer perspective (For most cases,
an E-commerce store is merely a Sales Channel and automation platform, comparable to a Brick-and-mortar store with
employees that perform sales related activities).

Simply put, E-Commerce is when a business sells, buys, or makes a transaction in a digital marketplace over the internet. This generally involves selling a product via a Website that has been created with the option make a purchase with a few clicks.

### E-Commerce Business activities

The general activities in an E-Commerce business fall into 5 major groups:

#### Product Sourcing / Inventory Management

#### Marketing & Sales

#### Fulfillment

#### Customer Service

#### Data Analysis
