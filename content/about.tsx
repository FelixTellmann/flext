      <p>
        I'm a Cape Town based Web Developer and Entrepreneur. My focus area for the past few years
        has been front-end development with <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>Typescript</strong>{" "}
        and <strong>TailwindCSS</strong> to create beautiful user- and developer experiences that
        bring delight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™ve spent most of my life deeply interested in technology and food, continuously building
        things with both. As a teenager, I was a classic computer nerd, spending most of my times
        messing with the computer, doing 1 of 4 things: Modding games and figuring things out.
        Tinkering with hardware, building computers. Developing websites with FrontPage 98 and
        Flash. And of course, playing games.
      </p>
      <p>Most of that is still true today.</p>
